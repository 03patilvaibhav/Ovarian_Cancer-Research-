Histopath Right adnexal mass dated 06/09/2021 endometroid adenocarcinoma. Tumor markers: CA 125 827 ng/ml dated 29/11/2021. COMPARISON: Prior CT is not available for comparison.  TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis has been performed on a MDCT scanner.  FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  Pelvic Viscera - Hypodense cystic lesion 1s seen in right adnexa, measuring 4.8 x 4.7 cm. It shows multiple enhancing septations within. A tiny calcification is seen in its wall. Obvious solid component is not seen. Right ovary is not seen separately from the lesion.  Anteriorly it is abutting urinary bladder and few ileal loops.  Laterally abutting External iliac vessels. It is also compressing/encasing/causing adhesion to the right lower ureter resulting 1n its upstream dilatation.  Medially it is abutting right lateral aspect of uterus.  Uterus is normal in size and it shows hypodense collection within approx. measuring 14 x 10 x 18 mm (2-3 CC). Cervix is atrophied/fibrosed, likely secondary to post treatment changes. (MRI 1s better modality to look for local disease.)  Left ovary is unremarkable.  Few enlarged suspicious lymph nodes are seen in para-aortic region. Few sub centimetric sized indeterminate lymph nodes are seen in largest measuring 11 x 9 mm (5:380).  Liver: No focal lesion. Billiary radicles are not dilated. Vessels are patent. Gallbladder: Well distended. Unremarkable.  Spleen: Unremarkable.  Pancreas: Unremarkable.  Adrenals: Unremarkable.  Kidneys and Ureters: Right kidney measures 7.6 x 3.5 cm. There is moderate right hydroureteronephrosis. Left kidney is Unremarkable.  Abdominal Lymph Nodes and Retroperitoneum:  Bowel: Bowel loops are not dilated. Unremarkable.  Peritoneum: Unremarkable.  Free fluid: No free fluid is seen.  Bladder: Unremarkable.  Abdominal wall: Unremarkable.  CHEST:Lungs: Two tiny nodules are seen 1n right lower lobe (5:128, 143) largest measuring 3 mm _ too small to characterize.  Pleura: No pleural effusion on either side.  Thoracic lymph nodes: No significantly enlarged mediastinal, bilateral hilar, axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  Mediastinum and esophagus: Unremarkable.  Heart and great vessels: Unremarkable.  Chest wall: Unremarkable.  Thyroid: Unremarkable.  Bones: No suspicious bone lesion.  IMPRESSION  CT reveals,  1. Hypodense cystic lesion in right adnexa consistent with neoplastic etiology.  2. Suspicious involvement of right lower ureter by right adnexal mass with resultant right hydroureteronephrosis as described.  2. Few enlarged suspicious lymph nodes in para-aortic region.  3. Few indeterminate mesenteric lymph nodes.  4.
